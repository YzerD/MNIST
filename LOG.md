Project: Neural Network From Scratch Using Python

Date:[08-04-2023]:
    Today marks the start of this project of creating a Neural Network from 
scratch using Python. The reason for this project is because I've watched a
couple of videos on this premise and have an interest in Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence in general.
I'm aware that Python has libraries that build the neural network for you such
as scikit-learn and I believe Keras? Regardless, I chose Python as the language
for this project because I know that we have to do a lot of math with matricies,
and numpy makes this easier to do. Another reason as to why I'm planning to 
build a neural network from scratch is to better understand the underlying
operation that goes on in Neural Network, rather than just use the library and
not understand how or why it works.
    I aim to gain more familiar with concepts such as forward propagation, 
backward propagation, neurons, activation function, weights, training, and
Python, as well as the libraries. For this next entry, I'm going to read up
on Neural Network's from scratch using the MNIST database. (Make sure to 
properly cite the sources and explain what the MNIST database is). Get all
key topics and define them to the best of my ability.
